# Commonly asked C++ constructs in interviews

This repository is a collection of various implementations of containers and other C++ constructs. The primary goal is to serve as a training resource for exploring and understanding C++ programming concepts and techniques. This is also a good starting point for C++ interview prep.

## Overview

- **Custom Containers:** Includes self-made implementations of common containers such as vectors, lists, maps, and more.
- **C++ Constructs:** Experimentation with different C++ features and design patterns to gain a deeper insight into language internals.

## Disclaimer

This project is solely for training purposes. The implementations here are meant for personal exploration and are not optimized for production use.
