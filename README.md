# Commonly asked C++ constructs in interviews

This repository is a collection of various implementations of containers and other C++ constructs. The primary goal is to serve as a training resource for exploring and understanding C++ programming concepts and techniques.

## Overview

- **Custom Containers:** Includes self-made implementations of common containers such as vectors, lists, maps, and more.
- **C++ Constructs:** Experimentation with different C++ features and design patterns to gain a deeper insight into language internals.

## Disclaimer

This project is solely for training purposes and should (obviously) not be viewed as an attempt to improve or replace the Standard Template Library (STL). The implementations here are meant for personal exploration and are not optimized for production use.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the repository, run the code, and adapt it. Contributions that enhance understanding and offer educational value are welcome!
